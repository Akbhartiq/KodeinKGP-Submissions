    <div><span class="web_heading">1.Web 1.o</span></div>
    <div class="descript">->Web 1.o is referred to as the first stage of web develoment,this was mostly read only form
        of the web.This
        web1.o was into existence from 1991 to 2004.On these sites one can fetch information form the server's file and
        can read them.There were static web pages for the consumers .It was mostly the CDN i.e content delivery network
        that allows the flow of information in one way mostly, from the server to users.Ofoto ,in web1.o allows users to
        capture the digital photographs and store them.</div>

    <div><span class="web_heading">2.Web 2.o</span></div>
    <div class="descript">->Web 2.o - the second stage of the world wide web development.This is current one where
        consumers can read
        ,write and create the contents.This is generally built over the html-the structure of the webs , css- provides
        the styling in the websites and the last but not the least , js- provides functioning to the websites and hence
        called as brain of the website.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="descript">->This is next stage of the web development and is currntly in progress. Here users will have
        the liberty to
        read , write and own.This is based on blockchain which means the users are going to own the
        data(decentralized),every one will be able to connect to the website(distributed) and immutable.</div>
