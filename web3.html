    <h1 id="Black hole">Black Hole</h1>
    <p>In this giant universe , we are living in the milki-way Galaxy, solar system on the 3rd plantet so called earth .
        Black holes are the magical solutions of the Einstein Equations .These highly densed bodies such that they dont
        allow even light to escape.Have you ever seen the curved path of the light?
        If this would have been possible we were able to see out back side without even using the Mirror,but this
        miracle is possible if you risks your life and go in the vicinity of black hole-the so called event horizon.
